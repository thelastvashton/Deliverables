Cybersecurity Threat Landscape (Part 3 - Verizon)
In this part, you should primarily use the Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report plus independent research to answer the below questions.
________________________________________
1.	What is the difference between an incident and a breach?
An incident is an event that brings into question any of the CIA triad for an entity’s asset, while a breach requires the disclosure of compromised data.

2.	What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by outside actors? What percentage were perpetrated by internal actors?

That would be approximately 69% breaches are perpetrated by outsiders. More or less than 34% of breaches involved internal actors. While internal actors can be identified as part of breaches, the report eschews from claiming internal actors perpetrated breaches.

3.	What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by organized criminal groups?

Breaches attributed to organized crime groups comprise nearly 39%.

4.	What percentage of breaches were financially motivated?

Financial gain drove somewhere around 71% of breaches.

5.	Define the following:

Denial of Service: Attempts to down an online resource by overwhelming it or its network with excessive traffic.

Command and Control: Also known as C2 and C&C, can be described as a channel over which a compromised device goes out to a malicious server to receive further instruction or upload any stolen data. They have a frequent association with botnets, as it is a means to instruct several compromised devices at a time.

Backdoor: Term used for a method of accessing a computer system that’s undocumented and typically considered a security risk or completely unauthorized.

Keylogger: Programs that collect user input in order to gain credentials and access.

6.	The time from an attacker’s first action to the initial compromise of an asset is typically measured in which one? Seconds, minutes, hours, days?

Verizon usually measures that span of time in minutes.


7.	When it comes to phishing, which industry has the highest click rates?

Phishing click rates are highest in education with 4.93%.
