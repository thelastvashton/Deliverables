Assessing Security Culture:
Step 1: Measure and Set Goals
Answer the following questions:

Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.
When you first introduce acronyms in a paper, it is good practice to spell it out for the first time as in Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), Buy Your Own Dog …? that way the reader does not have to look up, ask or infer what it means.

The emergence of BYOD practices has also brought along several pitfalls. There are increased risks for device loss or theft, mobile malware, and insufficient or even completely unsecured connections. The SANS 2021 Endpoint Monitoring in a Dispersed Workforce Survey lists many different attack vectors, but the most dominant ones were browser-based, phishing, credential theft, known exploits, and zero-day exploits. With the leading three attack vectors requiring some form of user input, educating employees on responsible security practices can significantly decrease the risk of breaches. And depending on the nature of the company, these policies can be pivotal in maintaining compliance with policies such as HIPAA, FINRA, GDPR, etc.

Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?
For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources.

With increasing numbers of employees using devices in both personal and professional capacities, encrypting data, communications, and connections to company resources have become increasingly important. Employees could be expected to utilize VPNs while connecting to specific internal company resources (depending on network structure), multi-factor authentication, and only interacting with trusted sources. Training can also include loss and theft prevention to whatever extent that it is able to be mitigated. Ensuring that employees follow these security practices relies on proactive creation of these policies, active compliance monitoring, accessible enrollment for employees, protection and segmentation of personal and company data, and education on proper use. Creating a security culture framework should be a holistic measure that provides employees security tools, understanding of their purpose, and the confidence to use them effectively.

What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?
For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders.

Checking access logs for repeat authentication errors or sessions at unusual times can help point out employees who may be compromised or require further training. Conducting surveys to assess employee opinion of certain solutions or systems to see if there are issues that may lead to workarounds can be a valuable step in making sure that security frameworks serve their purpose. Sending out test emails can also be an effective way of identifying employees who may require additional training. It may also be worthwhile to provide electronics recycling services to employees in order to encourage engagement and proper practices.

What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?
For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments.

Implementing goals for increasing the instance of self-reporting when issues arise could be a good target for an organization looking to create a security culture framework. Depending on what levels of self-reporting there currently are and even as security incidents decrease within an organization, engagement through self-reporting can serve as a means to continue dialogue within an organization.

Step 2: Involve the Right People
Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?
Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.

Helpful personnel to involve would include upper management of each department. They would be responsible for organizing training for all current personnel. They can also serve as intermediaries between members of different teams and information security. Their involvement could also help efficiently communicate what each team needs in order to effectively complete tasks while also meeting security standards. The heads of engineering and operations would also be beneficial additions to the team planning, testing, and rolling out any new security policy products and procedures. They would probably be the first parties brought on to participate in the initial stages of the new policy. Human Resources and/or people responsible for onboarding would absolutely be necessary for assisting with training both new and old employees. They’re also reliable advocates for employees’ interests such as privacy. Legal would also need to be involved to protect the interests of both the corporation and the individual employees. They may also be involved in making sure that any new policies are compliant with any regulations that the corporation may uphold such as HIPAA and FINRA. Other involved parties would include anyone responsible for allocating funds. Their approval would be necessary in acquiring the financial backing for new products and resources to facilitate the new security framework.

Step 3: Training Plan
Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:
How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)

Online training will occur quarterly, supplemented with two annual in-person training sessions. New employees will be expected to complete in-person training during the onboarding process. A monthly newsletter with information to help employees identify current threats may also be implemented, along with emergency announcements for any pressing security concerns that require immediate attention.
What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)
After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?
This portion will require additional outside research on the topic so that you can lay out a clear and thorough training agenda.

Ideally, training will cover everything from endpoint to internal corporate resources. To start, it would be important to define what makes a secure LAN connection. Employees should look for wired or encrypted wireless connections while accessing work resources remotely. Some resources may specifically require wired connectivity depending on corporate policy.

After establishing local connectivity safely, accessing internal company resources while remote could be accomplished over a VPN to provide encryption of data over the internet. It may also be required for cloud solutions or other sensitive applications the company utilizes in day-to-day activity. Emails and other means of communication should also be encrypted however, these facets of the security policy would be implemented through centralized management of these resources.

Ideally, work related tasks and logins should be kept segmented on personal devices with different apps or browsers reserved for that specific purpose and/or the use of a privacy mode. For example, in instances where employees may need to access contacts or calendars outside of business hours, having separate resources for that information can ensure that data is retained within the organization; even in events where employees depart from the company. It also provides employees a means of mentally distinguishing the two which can prevent accidents and mistakes leading to data loss.

While keeping work separate from personal data is a key facet of BYOD security policies, safe user practices are also important. Educating workers on device loss and theft safety and malicious mobile apps can not only protect corporate assets, but also their own personal interests. Training employees on spotting phishing mail can be an integral part in fighting against one of the most impactful and prominent attack vectors. Creating an awareness of attachments that imitate legitimate documents that are an everyday presence in the business setting is crucial in an environment where user input plays an integral part in the leading attack strategies.

While these measures will greatly reduce the risk of vulnerability, it is by no means a comprehensive answer to the challenges posed by BYOD policies. They are however, required when the expectation is that employees have their personal devices within arm’s reach at all times of day. Ensuring that employees follow these security practices relies on proactive creation of these policies, active compliance monitoring, accessible device enrollment for employees, protection and segmentation of personal and company data, and education on proper use. Creating a security culture framework should be a holistic measure that provides employees security tools, understanding of their purpose, and the confidence to use them effectively.

To get an idea or metrics regarding the effectiveness of training, test scenarios, log data, and surveys will be key. Checking log data to get an idea of the usage needs and proper protections to put in place should be rather simple in terms of methodology and impact. Priorities should be placed on maintaining a balance between user-friendliness and maintaining a secure system. Surveys also play a key role in ensuring that users understand the purpose of any implementations and that they provide sensible protection without encouraging non-compliance. Sending test emails to screen for phishing vulnerability provides reminders to employees or insight into who may require additional training.



Bonus: Other Solutions
Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern. Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following:
What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical?
What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?
What is one advantage of each solution?
What is one disadvantage of each solution?

UEMs are technical and partially administrative controls implemented with preventative, deterrent, and detective goals. A corporate UEM (unified endpoint management) solution is a rather holistic approach to managing company data under a BYOD policy. They offer a form of centralized management of devices that utilize company resources. They basically provide containers for all work-related applications and data to create a safe and controlled deployment/environment. It provides control over company resources without compromising employee privacy and provide deterrent measures for non-compliant devices. Their advantages include granular control over company resources while their disadvantages tend to be the high degree of control over personally owned devices and some pitfalls regarding access to logs and diagnostic information when the device isn’t capable of a proper connection.

Another BYOD tool mentioned briefly in the above policy framework includes the use of VPNs. They are technical solutions with a preventative aim. They provide encrypted connections to a company’s internal network resources over the internet. They can be a useful resource when accessing data that is internally managed on a company’s network. Their advantages include becoming readily available while their disadvantages include their bandwidth demand.

Secure remote access can also facilitate personal device use by eliminating the need to rely on securing a secondary device or the applications on it. This would be another technical solution with a preventative or possibly in need of emergency goal. It doesn’t necessarily fit the prompt, but I felt bad about offering VPNs for the bonus when I mentioned them earlier. Their advantages include having access to a machine with full privileges while their downsides include exposing a machine with those privileges to attack.
